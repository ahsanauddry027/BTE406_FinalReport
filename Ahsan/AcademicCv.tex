\section{Profile}
I am a passionate CSE student '\&' enthusiast (96+ credits, CGPA 3.71) curious about using my skills to help others. Through my diverse experiences, such as, training at BKSP, competing in arts and chess tournaments, building websites for NGOs, and volunteering as a developer for the BRAC University Cultural Club (BUCuC), I have learned the value of discipline, strategy, and service. I understand the challenges of university life firsthand, and I am eager to share my journey to support new students. My goal is to guide freshers with kindness and practical advice, helping them feel welcome and confident as they find their own path at BRAC University.
